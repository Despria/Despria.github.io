Christopher - Bad

I don't wanna be another him, that shit is over\
Finally, you found yourself a friend\
And you run him over\
Ever since the start\
I saw the end around the corner\
'Cause I know you so well\
So predictable\
You're an animal\
I can't let you go\
You're so good at being bad, you know\
So predictable\
You're an animal\
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad (uh)
My baby's bad, you know
My baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
You know I'm not gonna leave your side, and I can't deny it
Tried to play it cool, but I can't hide my true desire
'Cause I can see the dirty in your eyes, my favorite liar
And I know you so well, well, well, well
So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad, you know
So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad (uh)
My baby's bad, you know

My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My-my baby's bad, you know
My baby, my, my, my baby's bad, you know
I can see the way you look at me, waiting to attack
You are on your worst behavior, I want it just like that
